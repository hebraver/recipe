        <h3> The History of Tacos</h3>
        <p> The taco is a food originating from Mexico, long before the Spanish arived. These ancient Mexicans used soft corn tortillas with fillings like fish and cooked organs. It wasn't until 1905 that the taco was brough to the United States. Mexican migrants came to the states to work and brought their delicous foods with them. By 1920, the tacos brought from Mexico were slowly changing into the tacos we know today. The organs were changed to more palatable ground beef and chicken. Cheese, lettuce, and tomatoe became regular toppings. In a nutshell, the taco was slowly becoming a Mexican-American fusion.</p>
